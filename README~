CSE 521 Project 1 by team G2: Puneet Arora, Stacey Askey, Prahasaran Raja

Compile the code via make, which creates an executable called myhttpd.

You can use the executable by typing
./myhttpd
followed by the desired options.
Ex. ./myhttpd -s SJF -t 50

To create a connection, type
telnet server port
Ex. telnet timberlake.cse.buffalo.edu 6160
default port is 8080.

Once you have connected to the server, you can send either a GET or HEAD request.
Ex. GET /index.html HTTP/1.0
HEAD /index.html HTTP/1.0

To get usage information type 
./myhttpd -h
